# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description

As a coding student, I am finding organizational and note-taking skills becoming more and more valuable as I continue my education. My challenge for this week was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.

This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was already created as starter code. Through hard work and trial and error, I was able to build the back end, connect the two, and deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## Tasks 

### User Story
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complet

GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
